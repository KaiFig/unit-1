Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will design and make a digital ledger for a client who is a local trader. The ledger  will inform and organize her crypto investments and is constructed using the software python. It will take 30 hours to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria ———.

** add a description of your coin and citation **
